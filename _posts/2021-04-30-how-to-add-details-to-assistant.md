## Step 7

This is a very IMPORTANT setting. This is used in outgoing emails, hence be very careful while you set the value here. The assistant will build a sentence around a topic (such as one of your offerings). You add the topic in the ‘More Context’ field. Please read the sample sentences created just below the box before you finalize the value of this field.

You can assign the default schedule to the assistant. Click on the drop-down arrow and select the desired schedule. If you assign leads to the assistant and do not mention which schedule to use, the assistant will use this default schedule to email the leads.

## Step 12

If you have a brochure, add the link here. Whenever any lead asks for a brochure, the assistant will send this brochure to him/her. Make sure that the brochure link is accessible from anywhere. The brochure is NOT ATTACHED to the email, just the link to the brochure is sent.

## Step 15

Auto-generated follow-up emails are short and quick. Sometimes you may want to add an additional line in these follow-up emails just before the Call To Action statement. That's when you can use this ‘More Information’ field. Write a complete sentence in this field. It will be added like a paragraph just before the CTA in many follow-up emails automatically by the assistant.

Whenever you forget to respond to a lead, the assistant reminds you. Here, you can set the number of days after which you would like to get reminded. For example here the number is set to 3. The assistant will remind you after every 3 days
