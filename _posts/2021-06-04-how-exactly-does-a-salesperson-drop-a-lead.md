Generating leads is important. It creates sales and increases organic customers.
For Converting leads into customers, the salesperson needs to be on this toes, respond back quickly, do follow-ups.
Sometimes **salesperson forgets to follow-up** and the company looses a potential client. This is a significant cost.

According to what we have seen so far, **EACH salesperson forgets to follow up _at least_ 2 leads every month**. Even with the best CRMs! Founders and seniors forget because they are busy. Junior sales, interns forget because they dont KNOW the meaning of VALUE OF AN OPPORTUNITY. 

Even if you assume that each opportunity is worth a $1000, 2 misses per month is $2000 per month. If you have 10 sales guys, its $20k leaking from opportunity pipeline. 

In 7Targets, we have a feature of sending follow-up emails automatically, to leads who do not reply. Even after Sales person responds to the initial email from the prospect, where he/she thinks his job is pretty much done, the salesperson forgets to keep track of this lead, because he **thinks the lead will respond**. Guess what. Its a busy world. Most people you approach are anyway seniors and are out of time. Each salesperson must expect that his email is NOT GOING TO BE READ. **This expectation of expecting a response after sending the brochure is where sales drops leads**. Changing human behavior is more difficult than going to Mars. And here is where AI Sales Assistants come to the rescue. AI Sales Assistants picks up the followup tasks and minimizes the human effort and increase the chances of conversion.

You can try this process manually via your existing CRM and try to with high discipline in sales with regular meetings daily standing meetings. Or you can try 7Targets. The explanation of how you can do successful follow-ups using 7Targets is here. 

## Step 1 
Select the files which you want to look into. If a Salesperson has uploaded leads using 3 files in last month, you can go to leads and select "multiple lead upload"

Here you can see the number of responded leads. 

## Step 5
Click on one of the leads you want to first look into. 
Here, the 'Two Ticks' denotes that the email is opened by the lead. And the 'Link' icon means that the lead has clicked on one of the links in that email.

## Step 6

Dropping the leads
Here, the lead opened the email. You can also see that the lead has not opened any attached links.

Now here the salesperson thinks that he has sent the mail and his work is done but that’s the point where lead is dropped. After this communication, the entire conversation went cold, and your salesperson forgot to check back.

## Step 7
How to fix this problem of 'tracking leads that were sent an email already'? 

Assume we were to reply to the lead today. Click on the reply as shown in the image.
You’ll be directed to this page.

Scroll down and you’ll see the option “If no reply, followup using Reply follow-up schedule”

Tick that box and then follow ups will be activated. The Assistant will automatically followup this thread based on the schedule in 'Reply followup schedule'. You can create your own followup schedules for different types of follow-ups.

## Step 8

Here, are those 3 followup emails

Here’s the follow up message

That's how every month 2 leads are missed. Assuming the fact one lead is worth $1000, so per month you're facing a valuable loss of $2000.
To prevent this, try using 7Targets for an auto reply mechanism and you're safe from these traps.
