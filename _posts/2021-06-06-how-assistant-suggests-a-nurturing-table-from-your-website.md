The process of nurturing leads involves purposefully engaging your target audience by offering relevant information, supporting them in any way they need, and maintaining a sense of delight throughout every stage of the buyer's journey

Nurturing emotional relationships is the most crucial primary foundation for both intellectual and social growth.


Here's the explanation how you can successfully do it.


## Step 1
Click on the Nurture icon.

But most of the time a user doesn't know how to create a nurturing table. 

So there is a feature in which the assistant will suggest nurturing table for you based on information available on your website.

Click on 'Suggest' icon.
